        <p>A very light and fluffy pancake that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons baking soda </li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, melted </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, 
                beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate 
                until you are ready to cook.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the 
                surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!
            </li>
            <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, using a wooden spoon or fork to blend. 
                Stir until it's just blended together. Do not over stir! Pour or scoop the batter onto 
                the griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
